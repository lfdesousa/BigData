bin/hdfs namenode -format # to be executed only once
sbin/start-dfs.sh # starts the jobs related with NamedNome and Data Nodes
bin/hdfs dfs -mkdir /user
bin/hdfs dfs -mkdir /user/luisfilipe #Create my directory
jps # Verifies if the jobs are running
sbin/start-yarn.sh #starts yarn related jobs
jps #verify if the jobs have started correctly.

In order to verify if the Namenode is healthy we can check this:
http://localhost:50070/ Interface where we can have information about the namenode

before each one of the hadoop related commands, we can add it to the path, like this:
export PATH=$PATH:~/work/hadoop-2.9.0/bin
